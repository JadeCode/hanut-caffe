            <h3>"Black Coffee"</h3>
            <p>Wether you call it Black, or Turkish, It means you take the finest ground coffee and pour boiling water over it for a few minutes.
            The coffee will extract most of the caffeine and will be less consentrated than an espresso,
            but still have a strong taste.

            <p>Making coffee in a machinetta is a whole ritual, I love it.
              There are two kinds of machinettas - Mocha and Brika.
              You could also choose to have a machinetta made out of aluminum or nirosta, each has its own advanteges concurning taste and texture.
              All machinettas have the same parts:
              <ul>
                <li>A water container with a safety vale, the water should reach just below it. </li>
                <li>A basket where the ground coffee goes - you never press down on the coffee or it
                    would get stuck and the machinetta will burn. </li>
                <li>A container to which the drink itself flows through a thin tube with snall openings at the top.</li>
              </ul>  
              The machinetta Brika has an additional weight at the top of the tube, 
              making a smaller gap and builds more prressure for the coffe to go through 
              and the result is closer to an esspresso. 
            </p>

        <li id="espresso">
            <h3><span class="hiddentxt">Espresso</span><span class="hiddenimg"><img src="pics/4.jpg" width="250" /></span></h3>
            <p>The espresso is a drink more concentrated than the machinetta one, 
              it goes through even tighter openings in the <span>portafilter</span> 
              and in higer temperature. The result is a drink with a rich Crema and aroma that fills the room.</p>
        </li>  
        <li id="capuccino">
            <h3><span class="hiddentxt">Capuccino</span><span class="hiddenimg"><img src="pics/Inb_Coffee.jpg" width="250" /></span></h3>
            <p>A Caopuccino is a drink made of thirds:
                <ul>
                    <li>A First, an espresso. I would recommend something not too mellow so it would not dissapear.</li>
                    <li>Then, a third of steamed milk, to balance the espresso. </li>
                    <li>And finally, a third or a bit less of foamed milk to top it all</li>
                  </ul>
                  The word Caopuccino comes from the Italian word "cappuccio", meaning hood or cap. 
                  The foamed milk is the the drink's cappuccio.</p>

            <h3><span class="hiddentxt">Filters</span><span class="hiddenimg"><img src="pics/chemex.jpg" width="250" /></span></h3>
            <p>Making a filter coffee is making a cup of coffee which is more mild than the espresso, and yet it has different flavours. 
                The way the water goes through the coffee only once leaves not so harsh drink and no coffee in the cup.
                There are a few kinds of filters: paper, cloth, plasic and metal. Each requires a different width of grounded coffee.
                I would recommend the stroger-tasting and more acidic kinds of coffees and blends for the filter, 
                so they would become milder and keep thier rich flavour.<br>
                Another kind of filter is the French Press. The french press has a glass cilinder and a thin round metal filter with a handle going
                up and down. The metal filter pushes the ground cofffee trough the hot water.
